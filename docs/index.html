    <h2 id="heuristic-evaluation">Results of Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
    <p>As mentioned before we used Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics to identify design flaws. Below is a summary of the findings:</p>

            <td>Visibility of system status</td>
            <td>No feedback after tapping “Add to Shopping Cart” or “Remove from Wishlist”</td>
            <td>3 (High)</td>
            <td>Include a popup message confirming the action</td>

        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>User Control and Freedom</td>

        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Error Prevention</td>
            <td>No confirmation dialog before removing an item from the shopping cart</td>
            <td>2 (Moderate)</td>
            <td>Add a confirmation dialog</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>Flexibility and efficiency of use</td>
            <td>No search history or quick filters for frequently used queries</td>
            <td>2 (Moderate)</td>
            <td>Include search history or shortcuts to improve user efficiency</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>Aesthetic and minimalist design</td>
            <td>A lot of unused space in the “Bookstore” title bar</td>
            <td>1 (Low)</td>
            <td>Reduce unused space in the title bar to enhance aesthetics</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</td>
            <td>If the user enters an invalid search query, there is no message to inform them that no results were found</td>
            <td>3 (High)</td>
            <td>Add a “No results found” message</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        The heuristic evaluation identified several usability issues, with the most critical ones being the lack of feedback
        for user actions and limited control over undoing actions. Key improvements include adding confirmation dialogs,
        better feedback mechanisms, and more efficient navigation features like search history or quick filters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Out of the six issues, three were categorized as high severity, indicating that addressing these will have the
        most significant impact on user experience. The remaining issues were moderate to low severity and focus more
        on enhancing aesthetics and preventing minor errors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, the evaluation highlights the app's strengths in design while pointing out specific areas for refinement
        to achieve a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.

    <h2 id="usability-test">Results of the Usability Test</h2>
    <p>The Usabilty Test was performed with our initial mockups. We did the test with 5 participants, all of them were male.
        The age range of the participants was from 21 to 25 years. Our team tested the following 4 tasks we already mentioned in the "Usability Test Plan" sector.
    </p>
    <p>For the Analysis of our Data we used RStudio. The graph results are presented in the following section.</p>
    <h3>Time on Task</h3>
    <p>While the Usability Test we recorded the Time on Task for each participant. In the graph below you can clearly see that 3 of 4 tasks were completed under 14 seconds.
        That shows that the participants were able to complete the tasks very efficiently. The 4<sup>th</sup> task "Add a book to the cart and proceed to checkout." took
        the longest with around 24 seconds. Which shows that this task was a bit complex or just took a little bit longer then the other ones.
    </p>
    <img src="images/Time_on_task.png" alt="Time on Task">
    <h3>Success Rate</h3>
    <p>We also recorded the Success Rate of each task. The Success Rate shows the percentage of users who were able to complete a task. In our test we
    achieved a complete success, which means we had no errors to record. In the graph below you can see the Success Rate by task.
    </p>
    <img src="images/Success_rate.png" alt="Success Rate">
    <h3>SUS Score Distribution</h3>
    <p> After the completion of all tasks, we told the participants to fill out our System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire on Google Forms.
        Our team achieved an average SUS score of 95, which is an excellent score.
    </p>

    <h4>Selina Hacker</h4>
    <p> The third semester code lab was undoubtedly the most enjoyable experience I've had so far. Working collaboratively made the project both more manageable and more enjoyable. Working on the bookstore app gave me a chance to really dive into app development, especially in making the app look good, analysing how users interact with it, and keeping our project documents organized. One big challenge was adapting the different features of the app to make it look engaging. <br>
        I had a few different jobs on this project. Mostly, I focused on the design of the app, where I tried to make sure that everything looked clean and not too cluttered. I designed every screen and really tried to meet the design of our mock-up screens. Of course, I ran into a lot of UI/UX design challenges, but in the end, I managed to do everything I wanted to do. The greatest challenge I faced was the welcome screen with the fitting animation, which was necessary due to uneven UI loading. <br>
        Also, after receiving some feedback, I made some changes to different interactions to ensure every action was clear. <br>
        I was also in charge of our GitHub pages, making sure our documentation was well-structured and that everything we needed was there. <br>
        This project taught me a lot about planning ahead, which I think Alikhan and I managed very well. I also learned how valuable it is to use data to make decisions. I really enjoyed working with my teammate; it was great to share ideas with each other. <br>
        Looking back, I see how much I’ve learned and how much more confident I feel now about making apps. The challenges were tough, and a few were very time-consuming, but getting through them taught me that I can handle problems and find solutions.<br>
        Overall, working on this project was far less stressful with a partner than alone, and I greatly appreciate Alikhan for being such an excellent teammate.
    </p>

    <h4>Alikhan Manat</h4>
    <p>
        As I primarily took responsibility for the app’s functionality, I found the overall process relatively straightforward, thanks to the Mobile Coding course conducted by Christoph Oswald. However, I struggled to fully understand why all UI components should be contained in composables, why it is necessary to create ViewModels for each screen, and how to trigger a ViewModel to re-execute and fetch the most updated data. I received valuable help from tutors Katharina, Ramon Brullo, and Hesham in resolving these challenges. <br>
        As mentioned earlier, my responsibilities included setting up a database with Entities, DAOs, Strategy Migration, Repository, ViewModels, search functionality, and buttons for adding books to the wishlist and cart. I believe the app successfully fulfilled all the goals Selina and I set for our final product, such as enabling users to discover new books, save and purchase them, and leave comments on specific titles. <br>
        For future improvements, I would consider replacing the current API, as it primarily provides IT books, which was not entirely aligned with our initial plan. Additionally, I would incorporate new features based on feedback gathered during the exhibition process.
