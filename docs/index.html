    <h2 id="usability-test-plan">Usability Test Plan</h2>
    <h3>Test Design</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the test is to evaluate the usability of the app, focusing on how intuitive and efficient it is for users to search for, purchase, and manage books, as well as to identify areas for improvement based on heuristic evaluations and user feedback.</p>

    <h3>Participants</h3>
    <h4>Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
    <p>Conducted by the Bookstore team members familiar with usability principles to identify design flaws early on.</p>
    <h4>User Testing</h4>
    <p>Participants will include 5-7 users from the target audience, such as book enthusiasts and students.</p>

    <h3>Environment</h3>
    <h4>Testing</h4>
    <p>We use our Figma Prototype for the User Testing.</p>
    <h4>Tools</h4>
    <p>Note-taking tools will be used to document observations.</p>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <h4>Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
    <p>Evaluators will apply Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics to assess the prototype.</p>
    <h4>User Testing</h4>
    <p>Participants will perform assigned tasks while observers record task times, completion rates, and any errors.</p>
    <h4>Post-Test Feedback</h4>
    <p>Participants will complete SUS questionnaires.</p>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>Task performance metrics, user feedback, and heuristic evaluation results will be combined to identify usability issues and prioritize fixes.</p>

    <h3>Hypotheses and Research Questions</h3>
    <div class="box">
        <h4>Hypotheses</h4>
        <p>Users will find the app intuitive for purchasing books, with an easy process for managing their Wishlist.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>How intuitive and efficient is the process of discovering, purchasing, and managing books in the app?</li>
            <li>How satisfied are users with the interface for favouriting books and managing their Wishlist?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Data to Collect</h3>
    <ul class="custom-list">
        <li>Task Completion Rate</li>

    <h2 id="heuristic-evaluation">Results of Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
    <p>As mentioned before we used Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics to identify design flaws. Below is a summary of the findings:</p>

        <tr>

            <td>Visibility of system status</td>
            <td>No feedback after tapping “Add to Shopping Cart” or “Remove from Wishlist”</td>
            <td>3 (High)</td>
            <td>Include a popup message confirming the action</td>

        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>User Control and Freedom</td>
            <td>No option to undo “Remove from Wishlist” action</td>
            <td>3 (High)</td>
            <td>Provide an “Undo” button after removing an item from the Wishlist</td>

        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Error Prevention</td>
            <td>No confirmation dialog before removing an item from the shopping cart</td>
            <td>2 (Moderate)</td>
            <td>Add a confirmation dialog</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>Flexibility and efficiency of use</td>
            <td>No search history or quick filters for frequently used queries</td>
            <td>2 (Moderate)</td>
            <td>Include search history or shortcuts to improve user efficiency</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>Aesthetic and minimalist design</td>
            <td>A lot of unused space in the “Bookstore” title bar</td>
            <td>1 (Low)</td>
            <td>Reduce unused space in the title bar to enhance aesthetics</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</td>
            <td>If the user enters an invalid search query, there is no message to inform them that no results were found</td>
            <td>3 (High)</td>
            <td>Add a “No results found” message</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        The heuristic evaluation identified several usability issues, with the most critical ones being the lack of feedback
        for user actions and limited control over undoing actions. Key improvements include adding confirmation dialogs,
        better feedback mechanisms, and more efficient navigation features like search history or quick filters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Out of the six issues, three were categorized as high severity, indicating that addressing these will have the
        most significant impact on user experience. The remaining issues were moderate to low severity and focus more
        on enhancing aesthetics and preventing minor errors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, the evaluation highlights the app's strengths in design while pointing out specific areas for refinement
        to achieve a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.

    <h2 id="usability-test">Results of the Usability Test</h2>
    <p>The Usabilty Test was performed with our initial mockups. We did the test with 5 participants, all of them were male.
        The age range of the participants was from 21 to 25 years. Our team tested the following 4 tasks we already mentioned in the "Usability Test Plan" sector.
    </p>
    <p>For the Analysis of our Data we used RStudio. The graph results are presented in the following section.</p>
    <h3>Time on Task</h3>
    <p>While the Usability Test we recorded the Time on Task for each participant. In the graph below you can clearly see that 3 of 4 tasks were completed under 14 seconds.
        That shows that the participants were able to complete the tasks very efficiently. The 4<sup>th</sup> task "Add a book to the cart and proceed to checkout." took
        the longest with around 24 seconds. Which shows that this task was a bit complex or just took a little bit longer then the other ones.
    </p>
    <img src="images/Time_on_task.png" alt="Time on Task">
    <h3>Success Rate</h3>
    <p>We also recorded the Success Rate of each task. The Success Rate shows the percentage of users who were able to complete a task. In our test we
    achieved a complete success, which means we had no errors to record. In the graph below you can see the Success Rate by task.
    </p>
    <img src="images/Success_rate.png" alt="Success Rate">
    <h3>SUS Score Distribution</h3>
    <p> After the completion of all tasks, we told the participants to fill out our System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire on Google Forms.
        Our team achieved an average SUS score of 95, which is an excellent score.
    </p>
